The solution involves accessing state or props only after the component has mounted, ideally within the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  state = { count: 0 };

  componentDidMount() {
    const { initialCount, someProp } = this.props; // destructure for better readability
    console.log(someProp); // Access props safely
    this.setState({ count: initialCount || 0 }); // Handle potential undefined props
  }

  render() {
    return <Text>{this.state.count}</Text>;
  }
}
```

**Key Improvements:**

* **Initialization in state:** The initial state is set directly within the `state` object declaration for simplicity.
* **Conditional state update:**  The `initialCount` prop is accessed after component mount, and a default value (0) is used if the prop is undefined. This handles potential errors gracefully.
* **Destructuring:** Destructuring assignment makes accessing props more readable.
* **`componentDidMount`:** This is the appropriate lifecycle method for accessing props and performing actions after the component has finished mounting.
